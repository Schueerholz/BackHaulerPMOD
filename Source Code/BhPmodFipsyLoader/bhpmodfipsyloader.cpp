/* FIPSY_WRITECONFIGURATION writes a JEDEC file to the configuration 
   flash and the feature switches.  This does not erase the chip or load 
   the configuration.  The chip must be erased before entry using the above 
   routine, and therefore will also be in programming mode. 

   This routine accepts a filename as a full path string.  It is assumed that
   the file is a JEDEC file and is structured as required for the target chip.
   There is very little explicit error checking, although there is some 
   error checking is undertaking by looking for specific features.  There is
   still no checking of checksums and other such features, mostly to keep this
   code as simple as possible. We also do make some effort to make this as 
   ANSI-C portable as possible.
   
   Importantly, a JEDEC file has the '*' character as the field delimiter, 
   so white space should not be used in code as a delimiter (CR, LF, etc), 
   even if most files we are working with are structured in a way that seems
   to suggest that might work, and even might work in a specific version.  
   We want to parse this strictly according to JEDEC, though we use the 
   presentation of this information from the Lattice manual.  We do assume
   that the JEDEC file is not encrypted, we ignore any security fuse
   or OTP fuse settings, and we do not program the user code.  Finally, 
   we assume the default fuse state is the erased state and do not program
   unspecified fuses to that nor use it to validate the checksum. 

   This version now fully parses the JEDEC file to be sure the SPI slave port
   is not going to be disabled before allowing the programming to begin.
   We could look at header matter to determine the same thing in various ways,
   but there is not guaranteed that the header matter won't change in other
   versions of diamond.  So we look at the feature row directly.  That does
   mean we could still be spoofed, but only by user intent.

   Note that the delimiter ('*') is also whitespace in this context.  This is
   like a line terminator in a sense, so if we have not already read it, we 
   don't want to now read it and return it.  This could happen if it is 
   the first character in a file, or if a field ended with "**" or more.
   These technically null fields should be ignored in this search.
   
   So define white space as ' ', CR, LF, NULL, and '*' at least.  But in
   reality we equally ignore any character less than space, which includes
   most control characters, including the JEDEC file start and end STX/EOT.

   collected eight binary characters and converts those characters to a byte
   to return by reference.  The value returned is 1 if this happened correctly,
   0 if an error was encountered, and '*' if the field has ended ('*' found).
   Generally, unless something is wrong with the file, the full byte will be
   collected or '*' will be returned.  Other white space is automatically removed.
   A return value of 0 can be interpreted as a format error.  A return value 
   of '*' means the caller should assume the file pointer now points to the 
   start of the next field.
   
   Note that anything other than 1,0,* characters can be considered white space.
   If a character is out of place or replaced, and it disrupts the count of 1s
   and 0s, then an error will eventually be found.  If the bad character is there
   without affecting the result, then it has no impact this way.  In a perfect
   file, the characters so removed are truly white space.
